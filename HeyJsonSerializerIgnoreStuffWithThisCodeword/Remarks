Works fine with nulls, but obviously it breaks with false positives, i.e. values that the user actually wants to be null.

One way to avoid this is to use a custom constant value, maybe a randomly generated string with 64 characters. (2^70 combinations)

From a preliminary search, this requires writing a custom contract, as detailed here:

If this approach works, the randomly generated string should still change on a project basis, to minimize its exploitation.
